# ADR 001: Tech Stack Selection

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-05-05

## Context

For the PercentLast weather/habit-tracker app, we need a modern, full‑stack JavaScript solution with minimal operational overhead, rapid developer productivity, and seamless integration with AI and database services. Our target audience includes developers learning API integration and rapid prototyping for personal productivity apps.

## Decision

We will use:

- **Next.js (App Router)** for React-based server-rendered UI and built‑in API routes.
- **Supabase** (hosted Postgres + Auth) for data persistence, authentication, and edge database functions.
- **Vercel** for deployment, auto‑scaling serverless functions, preview URLs, and CI/CD integration.

### Justification

| Requirement                        | Choice             | Rationale                                                             |
|------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Rapid full‑stack iteration         | Next.js            | Built‑in routing, API routes, and zero‑config SSR/SSG protects against boilerplate.|
| Hosted Postgres & Auth            | Supabase           | Instant DB, Auth, and SDKs; generous free tier; simple RLS policies.  |
| AI integration                     | OpenAI + Next API  | Next.js API routes serve as a proxy; no separate server needed.      |
| Deployment & Preview environments  | Vercel             | Git integration with auto preview builds; easy env var management.    |
| Testing & observability            | Vitest, Playwright, Vercel Logs | Lightweight local test suite; built‑in deployment logs; optional future Sentry. |

## Consequences

- **Pros**
  - Minimal boilerplate and developer friction.  
  - One unified language (JavaScript/TypeScript) across frontend, backend, and infra.  
  - Cost-effective under free tiers of Supabase and Vercel.  
  - Easy onboarding for contributors via `pnpm` and Git-based workflows.  

- **Cons**
  - Vendor lock‑in to Vercel and Supabase if platform‑specific features are used heavily.  
  - Supabase’s RLS and function quotas may require upgrading under heavier load.  
  - Performance tuning may be needed for very high‑traffic scenarios.

## Future Considerations

- Evaluate migrating to self-hosted Postgres or alternative DB if scale requires.  
- Introduce formal observability tool (e.g., Sentry or Datadog) beyond Vercel logs.  
- Add Docker/Kubernetes for local parity in more complex microservices setups.
